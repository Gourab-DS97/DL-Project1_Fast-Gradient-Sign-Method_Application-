# Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM attack): 
## Objective: Is image classification by Deep Neural Networks really robust!! 
* ImageSet taken as GTSRB
* Implemented application of non-targeted FGSM
* Implemented transfer learning from a famous pre-trained model (i.e., AlexNet)
* In first example, a **Stop** sign is being classified as **70 km/hr**. which in real life can cause a huge threat
* In second example, **turn to right** symbol is being misclassified as **turn to left** which again can cause havoc road accidient
* Both of the misclassifications are happening only by adding a very few amount of perturbation
